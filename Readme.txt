Air Pollution Classification Model Testing CLI - Readme

This command-line interface (CLI) is designed to simplify the process of testing air pollution classification models. Follow these instructions to use the CLI effectively:

Model Selection:
Execute "models_testing.py" to evaluate the models. Upon execution, the CLI will prompt you to select the desired model. Simply type the number corresponding to the model you want to evaluate and press Enter.

Dataset Selection:
After selecting the model, you'll be asked to input a number corresponding to the dataset on which the selected model is trained.
Different datasets may have different sample files located in separate folders.
Choose the dataset number as per your preference and press Enter.

Sample File Selection:
Once the dataset is selected, you'll need to choose one of the available sample files to test the model.
Use the provided list of sample files and type the number corresponding to the file you want to test.
Press Enter to confirm your selection.

Upon completing the above steps, the CLI will execute the selected model script and generate predictions based on the chosen sample file.
